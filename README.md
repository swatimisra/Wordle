# Wordle

For this project, I created a command-line version of the game Wordle. Wordle is a popular online game
where players have 6 chances to guess a 5 letter word. For each attempt, they recieve feedback on whether
the letter is in the word or not and if it is in the right place. This feedback is colorcoded yellow, gray, 
and green. If they do not guess the word in 6 attempts, they lose the game and the secret word is revealed. 

wordle.py contains the code for the project
secret_words.txt contains a list of words that will be use to assign the secret word. 
valid_guesses.txt is used to create a list of words that can be used to check for valid guesses.
